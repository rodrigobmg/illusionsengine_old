* @brief The main application class.
* @description The application interface is used to define the entry point for the game.<br>
* The application should perform a number of tasks which include:<br>
* <ul>
*	<li>Load and parse the configuration files used by the game</li>
*	<li>Parse command line arguments needed to correctly initilise the game engine</li>
*	<li>Create and initilise the memory managment system</li>
*	<li>Initilise static variables</li>
*  <li>Initialize the subsystems used by the game engine</li>
*	<li>Kick-off the game loop</li>
*	<li>Uninitialize the game subsystems</li>
*	<li>Shutdown the game engine</li>
* </ul>
